## Assignment 3 ##

In this assignment we had to handle a very large set of data. One way to do so is to use the Map Reduce Algorithm.
The code for the Serial Way, which is another way to handle the data file, was already created.
In this case I had to come up with the Map Reduce code.First we split the data, then we map it, we sort it, reduce it, and finally we print the output.
Here the output is the number of flights per airline in a given time period. 

Unfortunately eveything did not go as planned and I was not able to gather the results I was hoping for. 
For some reason the first part of the code that was already written did not work. Therefore I could not have the carrier counts. 
Then I still wrote my code but because I was missing the 'UniqueCarrier' part that was supposed to run in the Serial Way, none of my Map Reduce algorithm was able to run.
I believe that the code is right but I was unable to have access the final results and I am still not really sure why.
